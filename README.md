## Introduction

LinkTo is a Web3 aggregation advertising and marketing service infrastructure that was first launched on the BNB Chain. With the completion of the LinkTo Layer2 testnet deployment, in order to support the development of the L2 public chain ecosystem, the stablecoin TUSD was issued with excess asset collateral.

Stablecoins are highly popular crypto assets, providing a middle ground between traditional finance and digital assets. These blockchain-based tokens are similar to fiat currencies but operate like crypto assets, offering appeal in terms of “locking in” profits and losses. As of May 2024, the total market value of stablecoins has reached $160 billion, with high-market-value stablecoins like USDT and USDC pegged to fiat currencies and supported by reserve funds. Stablecoins backed by crypto assets, such as DAI, are also quite popular.

## What is TUSD?

TUSD is a stablecoin on the LinkTo Layer2 public chain testnet, pegged to the US dollar and aims to become one of the largest stablecoins and cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The supply of TUSD tokens is endless as long as users continue to provide collateral to generate more TUSD.

Unlike traditional fiat reserves, LinkTo maintains its pegging ratio by using encrypted asset collateral. How can volatile cryptocurrencies support a stablecoin? Simply put, the value of the encrypted assets that users deposit to mint TUSD is much higher than the value of the stablecoins they receive. This provides redundancy in case the price of the collateralized assets drops.

Like other stablecoins, TUSD has several advantages when used:

1. **It is more suitable for groups with stable demand**. Institutions, whales, and ordinary investors are not always willing to pay for crypto assets with volatile values, hence they convert highly volatile crypto assets into TUSD.

2. **TUSD benefits from blockchain advantages**, allowing stable coins to be transferred globally without the need for a bank account. If stored correctly, it is also a very safe and reliable form of savings.

3. **You can use it to lock in profits and losses and hedge risks**. TUSD will offset the overall risks of investment portfolios, helping to enter or exit positions without off-chain operations.

## How TUSD Maintains its Peg

How does TUSD, the over-collateralized stablecoin of the LinkTo Layer2 public chain testnet, maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar despite using volatile crypto assets as collateral?

When using crypto assets as collateral, TUSD is pegged to mainstream crypto assets such as BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and BNB. Users lock their crypto assets in the TUSD minting pool at a mandatory liquidation health rate to generate TUSD. To better cope with the volatility of crypto assets, users are required to over-collateralize their crypto assets when minting TUSD. If the value of the collateral falls below the mandatory liquidation health rate, LinkTo will force liquidate your crypto assets to cover any losses.

For example, a 200% mandatory liquidation health rate requires $2 worth of crypto assets to be collateralized behind every $1 of TUSD.

**Note**: When the mandatory liquidation health rate of an account reaches 125%, the platform will forcefully liquidate to offset all losses caused by the volatile fluctuations of crypto assets.

## Supported Collaterals for TUSD

LinkTo official/C2C trading acceptance merchants will mint the stablecoin TUSD through an over-collateralization mechanism. The quantity of TUSD minted varies when different crypto assets are used as collateral.

Currently, the supported collateral list and collateral ratios are as follows:
- USDT (1:1) TUSD
- TOK (5:1) TUSD

Upcoming supported crypto assets: BTC, ETH, BNB, USDC

## How TUSD is Issued

To support the thriving development of the LinkTo public chain testnet ecosystem, the LinkTo Foundation will utilize 25,000,000 TOK assets to mint 5,000,000 TUSD through a super-collateralization method of exchanging 5 TOK for 1 TUSD.

Out of the total, 1,000,000 TUSD and 1,000,000 USDT equivalent TOK will be injected into the TOK/TUSD liquidity pool to fulfill its initial liquidity requirements.

## What can TUSD do now?

As mentioned above, the use of TUSD is similar to other stablecoins, with comparable advantages.

1. **Leverage**: Suppose you have $1000 worth of TOK, and you expect the price will rise. However, you do not have extra funds to purchase more TOK. In this case, you can use TOK as collateral to mint TUSD, and then use it to buy more TOK. If the price of TOK rises and you want to cash out, you can sell some TOK for TUSD tokens to redeem your collateral.

2. **TUSD Savings Rate**: By depositing TUSD into the TUSD savings rate smart contract to earn interest. This interest rate adjusts continuously based on the proportion of TUSD total savings.
